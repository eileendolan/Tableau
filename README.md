With integrating data from the 2019-04 Citi Bike Trip analysis CSV file, I was able to build a set of data reports for the past year. 

The reports show a map of a start and end stations with records and locations of Citi Bikes in New York City found in the dataset. In addition, I was able to conclude that:

1) Popular start time is 5PM.
2) Popular end time is 6PM. People tend to ride for an hour from start to finish.
3) Popuular day to ride a bike is on Tuesday. 
4) In 2019, approx. 1.7 million rode citi bikes. The exact count is shown on the story board. 
5) More people subcribe to a 24-hour or three day pass in comparison to being an annual pass customer. 
6) The popular start and end station is Pershing Square North. 
7) Men born in 1988-1989 and women born 1989-1992 are most prevelant riders from the data set. Overall, men were the prevalent riders in comparison to women riders from the dataset. 
8) Men were twice as likely to have a long trip duration. However, the interesting results show that "unknown": not male or female showed trip durations close to the female trip duration. This means that some riders do not share information on being male or female, or identity as a different gender. 
People born in 1969 and 1989 were most likely to have a long trip duration. 

Additional research:
With additional, I would like to see if female riders tend to ride alone or with another rider. Why people born around 1969 were the most prevalent riders with people born around 1989 being the second riders. Why Tuesday is a popular day to ride, since it's a work day for most people. With riders riding between 5-6PM, we can conclude that people tend to ride after work. However, it is during dinner time hours too.
