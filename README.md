With integrating data from the 2019-04 Citi Bike Trip analysis CSV file, I was able to build a set of data reports for the past year. 

The reports show a map of a start and end stations with records and locations of Citi Bikes in New York City found in the dataset. In addition, I was able to conclude that:

1) Popular start time is 5PM.
2) Popular end time is 6PM. People tend to ride for an hour from start to finish.
3) Popular day to ride a bike is on Tuesday. 
4) In 2019, approx. 1.7 million people rode citi bikes. The exact count is shown on the story board. 
5) More people subcribed to a 24-hour or three day pass in comparison to being an annual pass customer (around seven times more likely). This shows that a majority of bike riders may tend to ride citi bikes briefly rather than throughout the year. This may be due to tourism or other unknown factors. 
6) The popular start and end station is Pershing Square North. 
7) Men born in 1988-1989 and women born 1989-1992 were the most prevelant riders from the data set. The comparison was somewhat close between males and females, with males being the most prevelant riders overall. 
8) Men were twice as likely to have a long trip duration in comparison to females. However, the interesting results show that "unknown": not male or female showed trip durations were close to the female trip duration. This means that some riders do not share information on being male or female, or identity as a different gender. 
People born in 1969 and 1989 were most likely to have a long trip duration. We know that people born around 1989 rodes the most bikes in 2019, but those born in 1969 had the longest trip durations. This shows there are differences between generations. 

Additional research:
With further examination, I would like to see if female riders tend to ride alone or with another rider. Why people born around 1989 were the most prevalent riders with long trip durations. This may be due to prime physical conditions. Why Tuesday is a popular day to ride, since it's a work day for most people. Is this due to tourism? Are people more likely to do other things on the weekends due to traffic? With riders riding between 5-6PM, we can conclude that people tend to ride after work. Traffic tends to be busy during this time and it is during dinner time hours too.
